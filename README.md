# SAPT_energy_prediction
##Prediction of SAPT energy components for ramdomly arranged water dimers

#Abstract
This project showcases the ability of simple molecular representations, in theis case colombic matrix, to provide sufficient information for a multi-layer perceptron to predict segmented interaction energies of water dimers arranged in 3D space. Our simpistic test case shwos that accuracies < 0.1 kcal/mol are possible.
